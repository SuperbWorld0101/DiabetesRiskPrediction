# DiabetesRiskPrediction
a new ML project to predict diabetes risk by analyzing relevant factors
After preprocessing and converting the continuous diabetes risk score into a binary classification problem, the logistic regression model achieved 95% accuracy on the test set. The dataset is balanced, so this performance indicates strong predictive power. Logistic Regression was selected as a baseline due to its interpretability and established use in medical risk modeling.
Limitations:
The dataset may not represent diverse populations.
The risk score threshold (≥50) simplifies a continuous measure.
Model performance may not generalize to real clinical settings.
External validation on independent datasets was not performed.
False negatives remain concerning in medical applications.
